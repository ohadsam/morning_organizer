# Changelog

## 1.3.0
- **Manual sync between the website and the Android app**: export a backup file or a compact sync code (copy / system share sheet) and import it on the other side by file, paste or share. Merge keeps the newest version of each routine (original timestamps preserved) and adds missing history; Replace makes an exact copy; optional import of settings (whitelisted and validated).
- Android: the backup export/import now actually works inside the app (system "save as" picker and file chooser; the WebView cannot download blobs or open file inputs by itself). Shared sync codes arriving via the share sheet open the import dialog.
- Voice: encouragement can be spoken automatically (independent from on-screen text) with the chosen voice and style - one Voice card in Settings.

## 1.2.0
- **Hebrew + RTL is now the default** (English one tap away in Settings).
- **Profile**: first-run welcome (name, age, gender), editable in Settings. All messages and tips adapt: Hebrew masculine/feminine forms, and three tones (kid ≤ 11, teen 12-17, adult 18+).
- **Mindful coach**: 35 short CBT / mindfulness / ACT-style tips (breathing with an animated guide, grounding, thought checking, letting thoughts pass, self-compassion, focus, time pressure, body) in two languages × three tones, with humour for the young. 💡 button on every task and next to Pause; optional automatic tips when a task runs over, 3+ min behind plan, or paused 2+ min.
- **Read aloud** (encouragement and/or tips, independent from the on-screen text; same personalised text, voice and style) with the device's text-to-speech: choose a voice and a style (deep, high, robot, chipmunk, giant, sleepy, superhero, fairy).

## 1.1.0
- Personal touch: your name + a buddy (🦊🐼🦄…) and cheerful, gender-neutral encouragement in Hebrew/English (start, 10-second warning, time's up, task done early/on time/late, pause/resume, routine done/ended), with emojis, pop animations and optional read-aloud.
- Stars (0-3 per run), 🔥 day streak, confetti on completion.
- In-app progress widget: segmented bar (width = planned time), live fill, walking buddy, % / tasks / expected finish; "in progress" card on the home screen to jump back in.
